## Project Overview

**A Simplified X (Twitter) Clone**

This project is a minimalist social media platform inspired by **X (formerly Twitter)**, developed as part of a challenging university semester where I concurrently:

- Worked on **7 distinct projects**,
- Worked **part-time as a software engineer**,
- Learned the technologies used in the project (like Vue.js, OrientDB, Passport) on the fly.

### Context & Constraints

- **Time-bound execution**: Prioritized core features under tight deadlines.
- **Full-stack ownership**: Designed and implemented the whole stack by myself.
- **Learning while building**: Adopted unfamiliar tools (e.g., Vue 3, OrientDB, Passport, Socket.io, Pinia) during development.

Despite these constraints, the application demonstrates:  
✅ **Key social features** (posts, real-time posts and replies updates).  
✅ **Modern tech stack** (see below).  
✅ **Scalable architecture** (containerized with Docker and served with nginx).  
✅ **Very cool graph data model that has great capabilities for scaling and extending the functionalities in the future**

### **Technologies Showcased**

#### **Frontend:**

- **Vue.js v3** - Application's frontend framework which I was learning for the first time while creating the project.
- **Vue-router** - Router for Vue SPAs.
- **Vite** - Module bundler for frontend development.
- **Pinia** - State management library applying the Redux pattern for Vue.js.
- **Socket.io-client** - Client library project's frontend-backend communation via WebSockets.
- **Axios** - My preffered HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Lodash** - General utility library.
- **Dompurify** - Library for sanitizing user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Nginx** - Web server used to serve the SPA builds.

#### **Backend:**

- **Node.js** - JavaScript server runtime.
- **Express.js** - Javascript web framework for Node.js extending the basic Node.js web apis.
- **OrientJS** - Official Node.js driver for interacting with OrientDB.
- **Passport** - Authentication middleware for Node.js, supporting various login strategies.
- **Passport-jwt** - Passport strategy for handling JWT authentication and authorization.
- **Socket.io** - WebSockets wrapper library.

#### **Database:**

- **OrientDB** - Multi-model database (graph + document).

#### **Infrastructure:**

- **Docker, Docker-compose** - The tools used for containerisation and containers management in the project.
